# Didactic Website for Multimedia Studies

This project is a didactic website created as an assignment for a university course. The aim was to develop a platform for studying multimedia, using the React library. The website is static and includes various courses, each accessible through pop-up windows. These pop-ups contain educational articles followed by tests to reinforce learning.

## Features

- **Static Webpage**: The entire website is static, ensuring quick loading times and ease of deployment.
- **Courses**: Multiple courses available, each providing comprehensive educational content.
- **Pop-Up Windows**: Courses open in pop-up windows for a seamless user experience.
- **Educational Articles**: Each course includes several articles that provide in-depth knowledge on multimedia topics.
- **Interactive Tests**: Tests are available at the end of each course to evaluate understanding.
  - **Multiple Choice**: Questions with multiple options to choose from.
  - **Drag and Drop**: Interactive drag-and-drop exercises for a more engaging learning experience.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Utilized for building the user interface and managing the state of the application.
- **HTML/CSS**: Used for structuring and styling the webpage.
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity and handling the logic of the application.
